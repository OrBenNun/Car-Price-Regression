Our group recently concluded a project in which machine learning regression models were utilized to predict car prices. To initiate the project, data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, including examination and analysis to improve comprehension and identify patterns or trends. Additionally, data visualization techniques, such as those provided by matplotlib, were utilized to understand relationships between features and car prices.

Multiple regression models were then applied to the data, using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, in an effort to construct a model capable of accurately predicting car prices based on features such as make, model, year, and mileage. After training and testing the models, the results were analyzed and insights were drawn regarding the most influential features on car prices. The overall effectiveness of the various regression models was also determined, and any potential areas for improvement were identified. The project was conducted using Python in Google Colab.
